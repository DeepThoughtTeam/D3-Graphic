# Deep Thought

Deep Thought is a graphical platform for the visual definition and editing of Deep Neural Networks. The system is a web-based interface that interoperates with leading open source Deep Learning frameworks. Deep Thought provides a cloud‐based graphical interactive solution to design huge complex neural networks, and allow users to experiment with various toolkit in parallel. Users could simply draw the network structure, select algorithms, and upload dataset, then Deep Thought could automatically parse the design, feed into multiple machine learning frameworks, train the model in  backstage and offer evaluations to the front‐end.
